## Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download and Extract the Zip File**

2. **Navigate to the Client Folder**

    Open a terminal and go to the `client` folder:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

    Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Server Folder**

    Open another terminal and go to the `server` folder:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

    Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Configure the `.env` File**

    Inside the `server` directory, locate the `.env` file. Open it in a text editor of your choice and provide the necessary values for the following environment variables:

    ```env
    MONGO_URL = # Input your MongoDB connection URL
    JWT_SECRET = # Input JWT Secret Key like a random string of characters

    # Email server configuration for sending reset password link

    EMAIL_HOST = # Input the hostname of the email server you are using to send emails
    EMAIL_PORT = # Input the port number used by the email server
    EMAIL_USER = # Input the email address used to send the emails
    EMAIL_PASSWORD = # Input the password for the email address specified in EMAIL_USER.
    ```

    Replace the placeholder comments with your actual configuration values. 

5. **Start the Server**

    In the terminal for the `server` folder, start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

6. **Start the Client**

    In the terminal for the `client` folder, start the client application:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

7. **Access the Application**

    Once the client is running, you will see a localhost link in the terminal. You can either click on the link or go to `http://localhost:5173/` in your web browser to view the application.
